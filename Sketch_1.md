## Sketch 1 Creature

#### Due September 17
			
Come to class on Sept 16 with code that is well on it's way to achieving the following: 

Write a program that creates a creature. Use at least 5 different colors and at least 7 different shapes (MINIMUM). Can you do more? Can you stylize your creature? How can you make them interesting and notable? How is their personality and style visually evident? 

Get creative and have fun!

The more, the better. Are they located in a space, environment or landscape?

Use different shapes, colors, opacities, sizes, position, etc.
